# NanoGPT2

This project utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to design antibody sequences using the PROTGPT2 model. The primary objective is to generate antibody sequences with specific Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) and framework modifications.

## Installation

To run this project, you must install Hugging Face:
